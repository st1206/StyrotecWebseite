The combination of additive and subtractive manufacturing allows for high-speed additive printing of components, with functional areas being refined using subtractive methods. Machining is often more productive and cost-effective than additive methods, especially for less complex geometries. Many parts consist of various geometric regions, and by combining both methods, the most suitable technique is applied for each area. In many cases, it is difficult or impractical to produce finished parts solely through additive manufacturing, so post-processing through machining is commonly required. Hybrid machines with integrated 3D printers help significantly reduce this effort."

Particularly suitable for large-volume machining of polystyrene (EPS) and hard foam on CNC milling machines. Together with special hollow milling spindles and high-pressure polystyrene exhausting units, the polystyrene chips can be sucked through the cutter and the hollow milling spindle. In order for this to work perfectly even when the tool is going inside of the block, we have perfectly dimensioned the suction openings and positioned them on the tool. Due to the special cutting geometry combined with the chip breakers, very high feed rates can be achieved with low noise and super-surfaces. Even the thinnest ribs remain without breaking because of the low milling pressure. In the standard version we deliver these cutters, incl. a interchangeable tip of your choice, with the 78/8mm flange for clamping with M90x2 cap nut.",
